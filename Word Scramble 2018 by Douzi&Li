//This is a Word Jumble Game.
//The user will see a group of scrambling letters in random order.
//The user will be asked to reconstruct the word and guess the word.
//There will be THREE attempts OR the user can choose to QUIT the game.
//While failing TWICE, the program will ask the user if he want to see a HINT
//If so, program will give the user the hint.If not, the user can continue taking his last attempt.
//There will be SIX words in total and each word will have its hint.
//After Three attempts, no matter the user won or not, program will ask him if the user wants another try.
//Maybe I will add a TIMER (60 seconds), or maybe not.
//This program is created by Douzi Ma and Li Lin.
//NOTE:IN THE PRES,PICK OUT TWO THINGS WE'VE LEARNED IN CLASS.
